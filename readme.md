Hereâ€™s a modified version of your README that includes the specified JSON structure for the `portfolio.json` file. I've added a section detailing the structure of the `portfolio.json` to ensure users know how to format their stock portfolio:

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**
   Start the Node.js server by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the server on port 3000.

2. **View in Browser**
   Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   You will see your stock portfolio with real-time prices and portfolio value.

## Portfolio JSON Structure

The `portfolio.json` file should follow the structure below:

    "portfolio": [
      {
        "stock_name": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)",
        "symbol": "TCS.NS",
        "quantity": 100
      },
      {
        "stock_name": "Infosys",
        "symbol": "INFY.NS",
        "quantity": 50
      },
      {
        "stock_name": "Wipro",
        "symbol": "WIPRO.NS",
        "quantity": 200
      },
      {
        "stock_name": "Tech Mahindra",
        "symbol": "TECHM.NS",
        "quantity": 75
      }
    ]
}
```

Make sure to replace the example stocks with your own stock data as needed.
