# Stock Portfolio Viewer

Stock Portfolio Viewer is a Node.js-based web application that lets you track and manage your stock investments in real time. It fetches current pricing data from Yahoo Finance, calculates your portfolio's value, and preserves historical data for comparison. The application now includes advanced features such as auto-refreshing data, comprehensive stock management (adding, editing, and deleting stocks), and a comparison tool (designed for dates within the same month).

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**  
   Start the Node.js server by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the server on port 3000 (or the port specified in your environment).

2. **View in Browser**  
   Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   You will see your stock portfolio with real-time prices, portfolio value, and additional management features.

3. **Auto-Refresh & Real-Time Updates**  
   The page automatically refreshes every 2 seconds, ensuring that stock prices and portfolio totals are always up-to-dateâ€”no manual refresh is needed after the initial load.
